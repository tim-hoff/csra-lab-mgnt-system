You can do pretty much everything throught the `activator` console.

There are several demonstration files available in the template. I'll keep them in until we hook up everything.

#Controllers
##DashboardController
##HistoryController

##UserController

#View Examples
noscript and script show how to effectivly use the template.

#Branching strategy 
before working on a feature, pull the master branch. Then branch off of that, the naming convention is feature/{feature_name}. When you finish work, diff it with master, and clean up your branch (remove anything you don't need to implement the feature). then create a pull request on github.
